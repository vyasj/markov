# Markov Chain Sentence Generator

I was bored, and needed a project to help me learn Rust a bit better. This is my attempt.

Train the markov chain on any block of text via a `.txt` file and generate a sentence of a given length by either picking the most common next word or randomly picking from the set of words that followed in the original text.
